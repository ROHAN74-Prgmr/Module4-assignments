Module – 4 : Node - Node with Mongodb

Q1. What is MongoDB?

- MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in a  document-based format. 

- It is document-oriented that is instead of tables and rows like in SQL databases, MongoDB stores data in JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON) in which each document is a collection of key-value pairs.
  
- As it is a NoSQL database so it doesn't use SQL for querying but it uses Javascript like syntax to retrieve data .
  
- It  doesn’t require a fixed schema , so you can store different types of data in the same collection without predefined structures.

- In MongoDb data is stored in collections  which are like tables, and each entry is called a document like a row in SQL, but much more flexible.

- MongoDB also supports indexing to make queries faster, similar to SQL databases.

- MongoDB is designed to be highly scalable and it is  widely used in modern web applications, especially with JavaScript and its framework Node js because it supports JSON.

- MongoDB is open-source, making it widely accessible for development purposes.

Q2. What is difference between Mongo DB and SQL?

-MongoDB uses a  flexible, document-based structure (JSON-like documents) in which each document can have different fields.
SQL uses a structured, table-based format with rows and columns. All rows in a table must have the same structure


-MongoDB uses its own query language based on JSON syntax, which is flexible and can handle complex queries.
SQL uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for querying, which is standardized and powerful for complex queries.


-MongoDb is not entirely schema-less database you can still give structure on your data using  validation rules, and data types but  SQL databases require a predefined schema for defining the structure of your tables, columns, and data types

-Mongodb is more flexible as it can handle semi-structured and unstructured data while sql is not so flexible as it requires a predefined schema.
